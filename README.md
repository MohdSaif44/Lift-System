# Three‐Floor Lift Control System Omron using SYSMAC CPM2A PLC & DL2122M lift model
Designed and modeled lift control logic with state diagrams and flowcharts to manage call registration, direction prioritization, door interlocks, and emergency overrides.
Implemented CX-One ladder logic on an Omron SYSMAC CPM2A PLC, mapping floor buttons, floor‐position sensors, limit switches, motor relays, and door solenoids.
Validated performance through comprehensive testing of single, sequential, and in-transit request scenarios, demonstrating reliable, real-world elevator behavior under all operating conditions.
